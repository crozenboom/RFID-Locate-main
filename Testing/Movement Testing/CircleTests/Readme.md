# CircleTest1 
- clockwise in each orientation slow then fast
- counterclockwise in each orientation slow then fast
# CircleTest2
- for 4.5' radius, center point in the center of the antenna grid
 - clockwise, slow then fast, orientation 5
 - counterclockwise, slow then fast, orientation 5
# CircleTest3
- for 5.5' radius, center point in the center of the antenna grid
 - clockwise, slow then fast, orientation 5
 - counterclockwise, slow then fast, orientation 5 
# CircleTest4

 - counterclockwise, slow then fast, orientation 5


# CircleMetadata.csv 
Contains information about the line path being tested for each csv file contained in the MoveTest# Folders.
Details concerning this data are as follows:
 - Path # is defined by 
 - Speed is loosely defined. 
 - Orientation 1, 2, 3, 4 refer to the tags faces as it rotates 360 degrees around a ground to ceiling axis:
   - 1 -> tag is parallel to the vector between antennas 1 and 2 (or 3 and 4)
   - 2 -> tag is parallel to the vector between antennas 2 and 3 (or 1 and 4)
   - 3 -> tag is parallel to the face of antenna 3 (or 1)
   - 4 -> tag is parallel to the face of antenna 4 (or 2)
   - 5 -> tag is always facing outward (away from the center point of the circle
