# CircleMetadata.csv 
Contains information about the line path being tested for each csv file contained in the MoveTest# Folders.
Details concerning this data are as follows:
 - Path # is defined by 
 - Speed is loosely defined. 
 - Orientation 1, 2, 3, 4 refer to the tags faces as it rotates 360 degrees around a ground to ceiling axis:
   - 1 -> tag is parallel to the vector between antennas 1 and 2 (or 3 and 4)
   - 2 -> tag is parallel to the vector between antennas 2 and 3 (or 1 and 4)
   - 3 -> tag is parallel to the face of antenna 3 (or 1)
   - 4 -> tag is parallel to the face of antenna 4 (or 2)
