# Testing
## Summary
This folder holds all the experimental data. 
- Tests 1-15 are static tests (Test 1-3 are identical)
- Fingerprint1 is a fingerprint test in a 6x6 ft grid
- MovementTesting contains dynamic Circle and Line tests 
- quadTesting contains quadrant specific dynamic tests
- Polarizationinfo is a brief overview of the impact of varying antenna types
- Hoptable is a table matching the channel index with the corresponding frequency

### Note: 
if information is not described in readme, it can be safely assumed that it was not recorded, and has consequently been lost to time. 

## Some Terminology
### Clock
In the 15x15 grid tests the clock analogy was used to indicate paths of travel. The clcok is always viewed as if from above in the same direction as the grid. This means 12 o clock is at grid point (7,15). 
### Antenna Numbering
Antennas are always numbered 1-4 and start from bottom left clockwise to bottom right around the room.
