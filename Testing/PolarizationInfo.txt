Impact of Antenna Polarization and Frequency Band in RFID Testing

In our RFID test setup, we’re using four antennas placed in a 15x15 ft area:
	•	Antenna 1: S9028PCLJ (LHCP, 902–928 MHz)
	•	Antenna 2: S8658PL (RHCP, 865–868 MHz)
	•	Antenna 3: S9028PCRJ (RHCP, 902–928 MHz)
	•	Antenna 4: S9028PCLJ (LHCP, 902–928 MHz)

1. Polarization Mismatch (Left-Hand vs. Right-Hand Circular Polarization)

Antennas 1 and 4 are left-hand circular polarized (LHCP), while Antennas 2 and 3 are right-hand 
circular polarized (RHCP). Since LHCP and RHCP fields are orthogonal, they don’t effectively communicate 
with one another. This means we may experience reduced read range and inconsistent detection in regions 
where tags are primarily exposed to antennas with opposite polarization.

We’re using linearly polarized tags, which are commonly paired with circularly polarized antennas in 
practice. Circular antennas are often preferred when tag orientation may vary, as they can energize and 
read tags at any rotation angle. However, there is a typical ~3 dB loss in signal strength compared to 
a perfectly aligned linear antenna–tag pair. This tradeoff is usually acceptable for real-world robustness.

If we had used linearly polarized antennas instead, we could have maximized read strength — but only if 
the tags’ orientations were consistently aligned with the antenna field. A 90° rotation would result in 
near-zero coupling, making linear antennas less forgiving in dynamic or uncontrolled environments.

If we were using circularly polarized tags (less common), matching antenna and tag polarizations 
(e.g., RHCP-RHCP) would offer optimal performance, while opposite pairs (e.g., RHCP-LHCP) would yield 
near-zero coupling — significantly impacting coverage.

2. Frequency Band Mismatch (902–928 MHz vs. 865–868 MHz)

Antenna 2 (S8658PL) is designed for the ETSI band (865–868 MHz), while the other three antennas operate 
in the FCC band (902–928 MHz).

If we configure our RFID reader to operate in the FCC band, Antenna 2 will be outside its designed 
frequency range, which will likely cause:
	•	Severe signal attenuation
	•	Reduced read sensitivity
	•	Poor tag detection or total read failure
	•	Potential signal reflections or interference artifacts across the environment

Conversely, if we adjust the reader to operate in the ETSI band to accommodate Antenna 2, then Antennas 
1, 3, and 4 — all tuned for FCC frequencies — will operate suboptimally. This mismatch introduces inconsistent 
antenna performance and may distort our test results.

Recommendations
	•	We should use antennas with matching circular polarization (all RHCP or all LHCP) to ensure uniform 
    coverage. Alternatively, linearly polarized antennas could offer stronger signal strength in controlled 
    environments with consistent tag orientation.
    
	•	All antennas should operate in the same regulatory frequency band (either FCC or ETSI) to avoid degraded 
    performance.

	•	We should continue using circularly polarized antennas with linear tags, as this provides orientation 
    independence — ideal for our testing environment. We just need to account for the small signal loss compared 
    to a perfectly aligned linear setup.

	•	Finally, we should monitor tag orientation and antenna placement closely when evaluating read patterns, 
    to ensure we correctly attribute any performance differences.
