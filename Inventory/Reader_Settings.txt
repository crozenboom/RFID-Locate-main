# Impinj R420 + Sllurp Reader Settings Reference

This document summarizes key reader settings available through the **Sllurp** LLRP client for the **Impinj Speedway R420** RFID reader. Use this as a guide to tune your reader for different use cases like inventory snapshots, real-time tracking, or portal monitoring.

## Inventory Session (`session`)

Defines how long a tag remains silent after responding to a query.

| Value | Name | Persistence | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|-------------|
| 0     | S0   | Very Short  | Tag responds again almost immediately. Best for high-speed environments (e.g., conveyors). |
| 1     | S1   | Medium      | Default session; good balance for general use. |
| 2     | S2   | Long        | Tag stays quiet longer after being read. Good for reducing duplicates. |
| 3     | S3   | Longest     | Longest tag quiet time; ideal for inventory counts where re-reads are undesirable. |

## Search Mode (`impinj_search_mode`)

Controls how the reader searches and interacts with tags in different states.

| Value         | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `SingleTarget` | Fast, reads tags in only one session state (A or B). May miss some tags. |
| `DualTarget`   | Alternates between A and B — improves tag discovery but adds overhead. |
| `TagFocus`     | Optimized for re-reads of the same tag. Helps prevent false positives. |
| `DeepScan`     | Tries harder to read difficult or distant tags — slower, but thorough. |
| `DenseReader`  | Minimizes RF interference in environments with many readers. |

---

## Report Frequency (`report_every_n_tags`)

Controls how often tag reports are emitted.

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1     | Report every tag read (default) |
| n > 1 | Report every nth tag seen. Helps reduce network traffic and processing. |

---

## Reader Mode (`reader_mode`)

Affects low-level RF behavior and how quickly tags are inventoried.

| Value                 | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| `AutoSetDenseReader`  | Auto-optimized for RF-noisy environments |
| `DenseReaderM8`       | Specific tuning for very dense reader setups |
| `MaxThroughput`       | Prioritizes read speed over reliability |
| `Hybrid`              | Balance between speed and read stability |

---

## Mode Index (`mode_index`)

Predefined RF profiles that affect dwell time, hopping, and power.  
These vary by region and reader model. Example values:

| Index | Typical Use |
|-------|-------------|
| 1002  | US dense mode |
| 1003  | US fast mode |
| 1004  | EU mode |
