# Feature Importance
# This file shows the importance of each feature in the Random Forest model.
# - Feature: The signal feature (rssi, phase_angle, doppler_frequency) or pairwise difference for each antenna (1-4).
# - Importance: The relative importance score (higher means more contribution to quadrant prediction).
# - Antenna_Position: The antenna's coordinates in the 15x15 ft grid (A1=[0,0], A2=[0,15], A3=[15,15], A4=[15,0]) or difference pair (e.g., A1-A2).
