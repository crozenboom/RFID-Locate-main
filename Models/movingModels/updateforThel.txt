RFID Moving Test Model Evolution

Updated: June 09, 2025

Start (MoveTest1, GradientBoosting):

Goal: Predict (x, y) with MoveTest1 + Test8, GradientBoostingRegressor.
Features: rssi_Ant1–4, phase_angle_Ant1–4.
Issue: Incorrect 4-antenna assumption, TypeError in fillna.
Output: Failed.
Performance: N/A.
Fix Errors (MoveTest1):

Changes: Excluded test_id in fillna, interpolated per row, logged antennas.
Output: 32 CSVs (60–221 rows, 4 antennas).
Performance: MSE 6.32, 7.60 (avg 6.96); MAE 1.77, 1.88.
Issue: High errors, aggregation lost dynamics.
Per-Antenna Interpolation (MoveTest1):

Changes: Interpolated per antenna, added RSSI differences, reduced estimators to 100.
Output: Not shared.
Goal: Better coordinate alignment, more features.
RandomForest, MoveTest2, Quadrant Prediction:

Changes: Switched to RandomForestRegressor, used MoveTest2 (diagonal paths), removed static plot points, added RandomForestClassifier for quadrants.
Output: 32 CSVs (98–239 rows, 4 antennas).
Performance: MSE 9.60, 9.44 (avg 9.52); MAE 2.50, 2.47; Quadrant Accuracy 50.81%.
Issue: Worse performance, low quadrant accuracy.
Seaborn Fix:

Changes: Installed seaborn for confusion matrix.
Output: Successful run.
Performance: Same as RandomForest step.
GradientBoosting + RandomForest, MoveTest2 + Test8 + CircleTest1:

Changes: Reintroduced GradientBoostingRegressor, added RandomForestRegressor for comparison, included Test8 (stationary) and CircleTest1 (circular paths), fixed quadrant KeyError, corrected stationary_indices regex, emphasized quadrant accuracy.
Output:
Stationary: 28026 rows, 64 test IDs (e.g., (12,3).csv, (1,12).csv).
MoveTest2: 4254 rows, 27 test IDs (e.g., movetest2-1 to movetest2-32, 5 skipped for <15 antenna readings).
CircleTest1: 3221 rows, 14 test IDs (circletest1-1 to circletest1-16, 1 skipped).
Pivot: Stationary 250 rows (incorrect, expected ~64), MoveTest2 4254, CircleTest1 3221.
Issue: NaNs in all difference columns (rssi_diff_Ant*, phase_diff_Ant*) due to incorrect pivot, causing ValueError: Input X contains NaN.
Performance: Failed due to NaN error.
Pivot Table Fix:

Changes: Replaced groupby/unstack with pivot_table for correct RSSI/phase aggregation, filled NaNs before/after difference calculations, simplified sample weights.
Output: Expected to process all datasets correctly, with stationary pivot ~64 rows, no NaNs in X.
Performance: Not yet available (pending successful run).
Goal: Improve MSE, MAE, and quadrant accuracy (>90% target), compare GradientBoosting vs. RandomForest.
Current State:

Works: Processes MoveTest2, CircleTest1, Test8; trains GradientBoostingRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, and RandomForestClassifier; plots dynamic points; saves confusion matrix and feature importances.
Issues: Previous NaN error in difference columns, incorrect stationary pivot (250 rows), low quadrant accuracy in earlier runs (50.81%).
Next:
Confirm pivot_table fixes NaN issue and reduces stationary pivot rows.
Use all rows instead of aggregating to preserve dynamics.
Add features (e.g., doppler_frequency, channel_index).
Optimize n_estimators (500 for GradientBoosting, 100 for RandomForest) and max_depth.
Target MSE ~1.0, quadrant accuracy >90%.
