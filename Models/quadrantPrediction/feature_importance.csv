# Feature Importance
# This file shows the importance of each feature in the Random Forest model.
# - Feature: The RSSI feature for each antenna (1-4) or RSSI difference.
# - Importance: The relative importance score (higher means more contribution to quadrant prediction).
# - Antenna_Position: The antenna's coordinates in the 15x15 ft grid (A1=[0,0], A2=[0,15], A3=[15,15], A4=[15,0]) or 'A1-A2'/'A3-A4'/'A1-A4'/'A2-A3'/'A1-A3'/'A4-A2' for differences.
